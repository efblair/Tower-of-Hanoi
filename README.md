# Tower-of-Hanoi
It is said that there once were 3 towers in the City of Hanoi. The first tower had 64 disks on it with increasing diameters towards the bottom. The monks in a monastery were given the task to move all the disks from first tower to the third tower using the second tower such that: Only one disk is moved at one time A disk of larger diameter is never placed on top of a disk of smaller diameter As the legend goes, by the time the monks moved the 64 disks from first tower to the third tower, the world would end! Your task is to write a Java program that can show how to move 5 disks from tower 1 to tower 3 using tower 2 following the same rules.
